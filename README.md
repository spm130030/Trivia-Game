# TriviaGame
Create a GitHub repo called TriviaGame, then clone the repo to your computer.
Create a file inside of the TriviaGame folder called index.html. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.
Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.
Create a folder inside of the TriviaGame folder called assets.
Inside assets, create three folders: css, javascript, images



In your css folder, create a style.css file.
In your javascript folder, create an app.js file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
In your images folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.



Choose a game to build from your options below.
You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 


The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.


Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.
Don't forget to include a countdown timer.
